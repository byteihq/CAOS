## Complex Instruction Set Computing (CISC)
### Architectures: Z80, x86
### Peculiarities
- Many instructions
- Encoded with different number of bytes
- Different addressing modes
### Pipeline
- Instruction Fetch
- Instruction Decode
- Execute
- Memory Access
- Register Write Back
### Pipelining problems
- Instructions have different lengths
- Different instructions are executed in different number of bars
- Work with both memory and registers

## Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC)
### Architectures: AVR, ARM, MIPS
### Peculiarities
- Only the simplest instructions of a fixed length and the same running time
